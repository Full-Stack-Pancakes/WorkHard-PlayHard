# WorkHard-PlayHard


***Do not touch master branch!***

Any feature you add should be developed on a branch derived from the <bold>dev</bold> branch.

Push to and pull from the dev branch, and then the whole team can ensure that it works before the git master merges it with the master branch.

git pull
git checkout dev (or git checkout [your own development branch])
